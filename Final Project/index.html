			<h2>Description</h2>
			My project will be an online Checkers application. Checkers is a 
			simple enough game with simple rules. On a Checkerboard, checkers 
			of opposing colors are placed on the black squares. Two players 
			take turns moving their respective checkers diagonally forward 
			trying to take all of the opposing players checkers. To take an 
			opposing player's checkers, with space available, a player jumps 
			his/her checker over the opposing player's checker diagonally. The
			opposing player's checker is removed and the game continues. 
			Another goal of both players is to progress their checkers across 
			the board to the other side where they will then be promoted to 
			Kings. A King may move and jump opposing pieces diagonally forward 
			or backward. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>Model</h2>
			<strong>Player Colors</strong>
			<br>
			WHITE    1
			<br>
			RED      2
			<br>
			<br>
			There will be an 8X8 board array variable to coordinate where 
			pieces need to go. There will be several methods to control where
			the pieces go. Furthermore, checker piece objects will be created 
			to make data on pieces easier to access.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>CheckerPiece</strong>
			There will be checker piece objects that will hold color data and
			a bool to determine if it should be made a king or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Game</strong>
			The Game object will contain properties that will determine whose
			move it is, what pieces can be moved, winning conditions, etc.

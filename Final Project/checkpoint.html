		<p>
			My game logic is in the beginning stages. I have a few functions 
			that move the checkers correctly with some of that movement,
			as of now, showing up in the view. I have also created logic for
			the player to see what moves are available to him/her. Coupled
			with that, I have editted previous code a bit to handle the game
			logic that has been written and will be written. The players may
			choose the color of the checker board as well.
